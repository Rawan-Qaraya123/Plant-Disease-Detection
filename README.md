Team Members: Rawan AboAlqaraya, Seda Betül Gül, Songül Kurgan, Fırat Arıkkan, Adile Güngör

Project Overview
This project involves the development of a web-based application that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect plant diseases on leaves. The goal is to simplify early diagnosis of plant diseases in agriculture, enabling users to upload images of plant leaves for disease detection.

Features
Dataset: Contains 1530 images labeled as "Healthy", "Rust", and "Dusty".
Model: Built using TensorFlow and Keras with CNN for training.
Accuracy: 78%
Web Application: Developed with the Flask framework.
